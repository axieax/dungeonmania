# Assumptions
## Dungeon/Game Mechanics
* There can only be one exit in a given dungeon.
* Goals have a quantity next to them which states how many conditions remain for the condition to be satisfied, e.g. :enemies(3) means there are still three more enemies remaining.
* When a game is saved, the name String provided should not be empty.
* In Peaceful Mode and Standard Mode, players begin with 100 health. In Hard Mode, players begin with 80 health.

## Consumable Entities Assumptions
### Potions
* `Potions` are consumed once. However, the effect lasts for a certain amount of in game ticks (depending for the type of potion). In our implementation,
  - `InvincibilityPotion` lasts for 3 in game ticks after it has been consumed (including the tick where the player consumes the potion)
  - `InvisibilityPotion` lasts for 6 in game ticks (including the tick where the player consumes the potion)
  - `HealthPotion` are just simply consumed to regain to full health
* If a player is invisible, they cannot attack another entity. Rather they can just pass through the enemy undetected.
* If the player is invisible, the mercenary and assassin will not follow them. Instead, they will make random movements until the invisible effect is over.

### SunStone
* If the player has a `SunStone` and the `Key` to open that door, `SunStone` takes priority to open the door. i.e Any `Key` are not consumed by the player if they have a `SunStone`.
* `SunStone` takes priority when building an item with `Treasure`.
* `SunStone` is consumed if it is only used as a material in building an item (retained in player inventory if used for bribing).
* `SunStone` cannot be interchanged with `Treasure` for completing the Goals

### TheOneRing

- When `TheOneRing` is used, the player respawns to full health and continues to battle the enemy until either the player or enemy is defeated.

## Moving Entities Assumptions
Here is a table detailing the spawn rate, health and attack damage that we assumed that the moving entities will have.

| Entity      | Health                | Attack Damage | Spawning                               |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ZombieToast | 20                    | 2             | Every 20 ticks (15 ticks in Hard mode) |
| Mercenary   | 50                    | 5             | Every 40 ticks                         |
| Spider      | 20                    | 2             | Every 20 ticks (15 ticks in Hard mode) |
| Assassin    | 75                    | 12            | 30% instead of Mercenary spawning      |
| Hydra       | 50                    | 5             | Every 50 ticks                         |
| Player      | 100 (80 in Hard mode) | 10            | N/A                                    |
| OlderPlayer | 100 (80 in Hard mode) | 10            | N/A                                    |

### Drop Rates

* `TheOneRing` has a drop rate of 10% after a battle has ended
* `Armour` have a drop rate of 25% after a battle has ended. Only `ZombieToast`, `Mercenary` and `Assassin` can drop `Armour`.

### Spider

* `Spiders` can move out of the map if they spawn on the edge and their â€˜circular' path causes them to go beyond the map.
* When a `Spider` is performing their initial movement (i.e. moving UP), if there is an entity blocking their movement, then it stays on its spawning position since it cannot perform its initial movement position.
* `Spider` starts with an initial direction of clockwise when spawned.

### ZombieToast

* `ZombieToast` cannot move a boulder as this action is only conducted by a player.
* `ZombieToast` will only randomly pick a free tile to move to.

### Mercenary and Assassin

* `Mercenary` can only move twice if mercenary is aiming to attack the player.
* `Mercenary` spawn at the initial player location after 40 ticks and `Assassin` has a 30% chance of spawning instead - but there must be at least one enemy in the dungeon, and the player cannot be in its initial spawn location
* Apart from the base attack damage and health, as well as the mind control feature; `Assassin` have the same functionality as `Mercenary` (e.g. same armour drop rate).
* There is priority to mind control an `Assassin`, before attempting to bribe it.

### Hydra

* When a `Hydra` regrows its head, and as a result its health increases, the total health can exceed the original maximum health.

## Static Entity Assumptions
### Portal
* `Portals` teleport all moving entities (except ZombieToast). Moving entities that teleport will still follow their original moving pattern. i.e. A `Spider` will resume moving in a circular motion after it has been teleported.
* Entities can only use `Portals` if a) there is a free tile in the direction of the entity's movement when passing the `Portal` and b) if the tile is occupied by an entity, it must be a collectable item or an entity that can be passed through. Otherwise, it will stay on the same position for the tick.
* Assume that there exist a corresponding `Portal`. If there is no corresponding `Portal` to teleport, the entity stays on the same position.

### FloorSwitch, Boulder, Bomb
* If a `Bomb` explodes by a switch, and there are other `Bombs` in the vicinity of the explosion, those `Bombs` can also explode forming a chain reaction.
* The blast radius of a `Bomb` is are any adjacent tiles (including diagonally adjacent tiles) to the position on where the bomb was place.
* `Boulders` can only be moved past a switch or an empty tile.
* `Bombs` can only explode once it has been placed by the user - meaning that `Bombs` spawned next to a switch cannot explode initially.
* Assume that `Bomb` explosions will not destroy portals (but will destroy floor switches).

## Buildable Entities Mechanics

* For `Shield`, `Treasure` takes priority over `Key` if the user has enough materials.

## Equipment Assumptions

* Durability of any weapon is not reduced if a player is invincible.
* There's no notion of holding an item vs having it in your inventory, so if a player has multiple instances of an item e.g. 3 `Swords`, it will attack the enemy three times.

### Equipment Stats

#### Attack Equipment

| Equipment | Attack Damage                                           | Hit Rate |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Bow       | 25                                                      | 2        |
| Sword     | 20                                                      | 1        |
| Anduril   | 10 (triple damage against bosses i.e. 30 attack damage) | 1        |

#### Defence Equipment

| Equipment      | Defence Multiplier                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Amour          | Inflicts 50% of the attack damage                            |
| Shield         | Inflicts 30% of the attack damage                            |
| MidnightArmour | Inflicts 20% of the attack damage and gives 15 bonus attack damage |


## Time Travelling Assumptions

- If the rewind is manually triggered (through endpoint/rewind buttons rather than the time travelling portal), the older player will retraced all it's moves until the moment it had rewind. If the player reaches to the position where it had rewind, then the old player disappears
- If the rewind ticks is greater than the in game ticks, it will rewind to the beginning (as far as it can).
- All observers (i.e. `Mercenary` following player, `InvicibilityPotion` effect) will target the 'current player' rather than the 'older player'.
- 'Older player' will follows the original path made by the 'current player', regardless of any updates made to the game state.
- An `IllegalArgumentException` exception is thrown if `time_turner` is not in the 'current player' inventory.
- The 'older player' does not have the inventory of the player in that point in time. It is merely a 'ghost' that retraces and battles the 'current player'. It is basically another `Enemy` in the dungeon.
- If a rewind is used during a mid rewind (i.e. if there is multiple 'older player'), only one 'older player' is on the game map and it follows the path made by the most recent 'current player'.
